- Software Engineering:
The concept first appeared at a NATO conference in Germany in 1968 to handle a software crisis.

The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware 
and the software development process. 
The crisis manifested itself in several ways:
- Projects running over-budget
- Projects running over-time
- Software was very inefficient
- Software was of low quality
- Software often did not meet requirements
- Projects were unmanageable and code was difficult to maintain

Software activities (or processes) vs Software development models
- Activities required to develop a software system. 
Activities include analysis, design, implementation, verification and validation (testing), and maintenance. 

A software development model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description 
of a process from some particular perspective.
Basic development models are 
- waterfall, 
- incremental, and 
- reuse-oriented software development.

Software Engineering: Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional software development.
According to IEEE’s definition software engineering can be defined as the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.
